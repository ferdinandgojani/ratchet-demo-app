                The system to sell Total Basement Finishing is easier than ever. Our products are the best in the market place, our sales tools are second to none, and our dealers are committed to excellence. We know that no two customers are the same, each have their own set of hot buttons and concerns. A salesperson has an average of 3 hours to build rapport, ask questions, discover the customer’s reasons for buying and not buying, inspect the basement, take the customer shopping, build lots of enthusiasm for the TBF system, and close. Miss any part, and the result will be a no sale. The best thing to do is to follow a framework that systematically takes the homeowner through a process that can accomplish these goals.</p>

              <p>We have a 9-Step system that does just that. As a matter of fact, for the salesperson, it’s less than 9 Steps. It’s only 7 steps since Step 1, Handle the Incoming Call, and Step 2, the Pre mailing, is handled by the office staff. The salesperson doesn’t see action until Step 3: Confirm, Arrive, and Warm-up.</p>

               We have a preprinted Customer Survey. The idea, of course, is to ask the written questions, write down the homeowners’ answers, and use follow-up questions such as, “Why is that important to you?” or “How do you mean?” or “Tell me more about that,” etc. These questions are open-ended questions and require the homeowner to further explain their position. These questions are invaluable for the salesperson so he or she can find out what the motivation is for the homeowner to have their basement finished as well as to find out what they value and what their concerns are.
The Customer Survey is a separate form that the salesperson has, however there is a sample one at the end of the Meeting Plan just in case the salesperson doesn’t have one handy.
At the conclusion of the Customer Survey say, with confidence:

￼“All right John and Mary, now I know exactly what you want to do. Let’s go downstairs, I’m sure I’ll have a few questions for you both. Then we’ll sketch and measure your basement, layout your new finished space, then we’ll come back upstairs and go shopping. Okay?”
