#Things Left To Finish


##9 Steps To A Sale
- [ ] Let's change it everywhere so it says 9 1/2 steps. It's dumb but that's how they teach it
- [ ] Let's find a TBF related image to replace the finished basement image
- [ ] Step 9 is a duplicate and should say "Close - with the Closing Trail and promotional offer. Print proposal and leave in presentation folder with brochures and book.
- [ ] Step 9.5 has a typo and should read "enthusiastically  on unsold proposals (not unsole)
- [ ] Let's increase the font just a bit more for the steps. I love the font size for the descriptions though.

##Scripts
- [ ] Let's change the first to buttons from "Call #1 & Call #2" to "Step 1 & Step 2". This also goes for the "H1" of those scripts. We can just add "Step 1" in front of what already exists.
- [ ] Let's change the color of the font for the word "Script" so that it's different than the "H1"
- [ ] We might also need to better differentiate between a script (maybe italics) and actions. Example: <i>This is what you need to say.</i> This is the action that you would take, such as start the video

##Materials
- [ ] "Cost VS Value" - we can review this together. We might not need ALL of the information on there but let's talk.
- [ ]"If the Price is Right" - Just a typo, otherwise good to go for now (If you are withinG $xxxx of the cost.....)
- [ ]"Right Sizing" - Let's clarify when a salesperson talks (script) and when a homeowner speaks. This will make it easier to follow/read. The form in the binder uses red for homeowner and blue for salesperson.
- [ ] Overall, there seems to be a more updated version of this form and we might need to manually enter it. I can do that though if you show me how.

##Closing Trail
- [ ] When selecting a script, a page pops up and you have to hit the "x" in the top right of the screen. If you hit the back button on your phone, it brings you back to whatever other page you were looking at before and not back to the list of the Closing trial. Let's make it the same across the board, whichever way that means.
- [ ] "Last Shot" and "Follow-Up Date" are missing
- [ ] When scrolling down the list, it opens whatever step you have your finger on at the moment after you have scrolled. It would be better if it scrolled, stopped and then you would need to select a step again. 
- [ ] Overall, we need to figure out what all of those steps need to say. Again, I will help with that. Just tell me what you need.

##Overall
- [ ] Once everything is done and all the kinks are worked out, let's polish her up and giver her a gorgeous makeover. The Home Page appears to look very different that the rest (especially Closing Trail) 
- [ ] I am still waiting for Chris K. to convert the AIFFs to MP3s but I will let you know as soon as that is done. At that point, let's revisit audio.
- [ ] App or website? Let's make that decision and everything else that comes with each choice.
