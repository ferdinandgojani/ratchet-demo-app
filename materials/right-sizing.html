              <h2>"I Want to finish The whole basement"</h2>

              <p>“Right Sizing” is critical in  order to be successful selling Total Basement Finishing for three reasons.
First, when homeowners clean out their basement and see all of the open space they immediately want to finish the whole basement. In most cases, this turns out to be far more finished space, than they actually need or want. As a result, the salesperson finds him or herself presenting large basement projects with large price tags associated with them.</p>

<p>The next reason why it’s imperative to become an expert in “Right Sizing” is to make the best use of available space in the basement. This is important because features such as hallways and closets can substantially increase the price of the basement project.
Lastly, “Right Sizing” the finished space ensures that the homeowner is getting just what they want which justifies the cost of the project.</p>

   <p><strong>Homeowner:</strong> I want to finish the whole basement.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> We can finish the whole basement. No problem. This is a great space. You have plenty of room, good ceiling height, your stairs are going to work just fine, etc. (Share good news and enthusiasm with the homeowner. This will lower their resistance and allow them to listen to what you’re going to say next.) <br>
Salesperson: Can I ask you a question? What is your favorite room in the house? Homeowner: Our family room.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> Let’s say we had an elevator that could lower your family room from upstairs down into your basement. If your family room from upstairs was in your basement, would that work for you? Great. Let’s go upstairs and measure the family room so we can see exactly what it would look like in the basement. Okay?</p>

    <p><strong>Homeowner:</strong>  I want to finish the whole basement.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> We can finish the whole basement. No problem. This is a great space. You have plenty of room, good ceiling height, your stairs are going to work just fine, etc. (Share good news and enthusiasm with the homeowner.</p>

<p>This will lower their resistance and allow them to listen to what you’re going to say next.) Can I ask you a question? (Identify stored items in the basement like this.) What are you going to do with those boxes over there, or how about the shelving over here, where is all that going to go if you finish the whole space, and the ski equipment, bicycles, etc? If this is going to be a finished space, where are you going to store all of these things? And I noticed you have children, where do you plan to store their future stuff?</p>

<p><strong>Homeowner:</strong>  I’m not sure.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> I can tell you where it’s all going to go. You know your upstairs closets, they’re all going to be filled to <br>
the top. You know your garage, it’s going to be packed with stuff. You’ll barely have enough space to park your cars.</p>

<p>Or worse, I’ve seen homeowners finish their basement only to have half of it used for storage. Are you open to some suggestions? In our experience, most homeowners leave one-third to one-half of their basement for storage for the reasons we just talked about. Also, realtors tell us that home buyers are generally concerned if there isn’t enough storage space in a home. How about this – let’s leave this area over here for storage, and we can use this area for your new finished space. This would give you adequate room for storage and you’ll still have plenty of room for your new TBF finished basement. Right? <br>

    <p><strong>Homeowner:</strong>  I want to finish the whole basement.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> We can finish the whole basement. No problem. This is a great space. You have plenty of room, good ceiling height, your stairs are going to work just fine, etc. (Share good news and enthusiasm with the homeowner. This will lower their resistance and allow them to listen to what you’re going to say next.) Remember I said that the cost of your project only depends on two things: The size of the space you want to finish and the features and options you choose to have in it? So I don’t make the price, the computer generates the price based on those two things. Just to let you know, I’m not going to pull a price out of thin air. Okay? So help me help you. What’s a comfortable budget you folks have in mind for your new finished basement?</p>

<p><strong>Homeowner:</strong>  We’re not sure. You’re the first one in. <br>
Salesperson: (Slowly look around the basement and picture the whole basement finished. Then say:) What if I said, to finish a basement this size could run about <span class="MathJax_Preview"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-8-Frame" role="textbox" aria-readonly="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-59"><span class="noError" id="MathJax-Span-60" style="display: inline-block;">_______.&nbsp;(For&nbsp;a&nbsp;full&nbsp;basement&nbsp;finishing&nbsp;project&nbsp;add&nbsp;about</span></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">_______. (For a full basement finishing project add about </script>20,000 or more to estimated price.) What would you say?</p>

<p><strong>Homeowner: </strong> There is no way I’m going to spend that much on a finished basement.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> So there is a comfortable budget. I don’t generate the price the computer does. Help me help <br>
you. What’s a comfortable budget you folks want to invest on your basement project? <br>
Homeowner: $_______.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> That’s workable. Are you open for some suggestions? (Now take control and right size the space in a way that makes sense for the homeowner.)</p>
</span>

  <span id="item4mobile" class="control-content">
    <p><strong>Homeowner:</strong>  I definitely want a bathroom in our new finished basement. <br>
<strong>Salesperson:</strong> Sure, basement bathrooms are no problem; we do them all the time. They look great. Let me <br>
ask you, how often do you plan to use this bathroom? <br>
Homeowner: Not sure, just thought since we’re finishing the basement that we could add a full bath.</p>

<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong>You certainly can. They look awesome. Let me ask you – what if I told you, that a basement bathroom runs about $14,000. (If the homeowner doesn’t flinch include the bathroom in your layout. If the homeowner is not sure if they want a basement bathroom say:) <br>
Salesperson: (Pause for 5-10 seconds) How about this – we’ll design your new finished space in such a way that we can bolt on a bathroom if you want one in the future. So let’s see what it would cost to finish your space. If your comfortable with the price we could always add the bathroom. Sound good?</p>
