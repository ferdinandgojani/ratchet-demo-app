        <p>“Let’s look at a family room addition. With a family room you still have to bring in the excavator to dig a big hole. Then you still have to pour a foundation, backfill the hole, landscape, and build the floor, walls, and roof. The family room is 400 sq. ft. with drywall interior, flooring, some windows, a couple of skylights, and all of the electrical. The average cost for this project is $87,000 or $217 per sq. ft.”</p>

        <p>“Now let’s take a look at a basement remodeling project. Remodeling Magazine specked out a 600 sq. ft. finished basement with a small full bath, a partition wall between the finished and unfinished areas, drywall for the walls and ceiling, some doors, all the electrical, laminate flooring and a bar. The average cost for this project is $66,000 or $110 a sq. ft. with a return on investment of 64%. The reason the return on investment is so good is because if you think about it, the floor, walls, and ceiling are already done. We only have to finish the inside of this space.” </p>

        <p>You can transition into it like this:
        Script</p>

        <p>“John and Mary, there are only three ways to finish a basement: drywall, fiberglass and fabric,
        and of course, the Total Basement Finishing System. Let’s take a quick look at each of them.”

        Script</p>

        <p>“John and Mary, this is usually how mold shows itself. If you look at the front of the drywall, you
        can see that it’s nice and clean and bright white. However, on the other side, mold is alive and
        well. By the time you see mold on the front of drywall, the back is most likely going to be covered
        with it.”</p>

        environment than the upstairs.”</p><p>Click and play the drywall video</p><p>At the conclusion of the video hand the homeowner a sample of the moldy drywall from your sample bag then

        <p>At the conclusion of the video, hand the homeowner a sample of fiberglass and fabric from your sample bag
        then say:</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“Although they came out with the first basement finishing system on the market, as you can see
        they came up short. People bought this product because they realized that drywall doesn’t work
        in the basement environment and were looking for something else. Would you consider using
        fiberglass and fabric in your basement? (Wait for answer) Let’s take a look at the TBF System.</p><p>Introduce the Total Basement Finishing System like this:
        Script</p>

        <p>“John and Mary, Basement Systems has the largest network of basement waterproofing
        contractors in the world. Collectively we’ve seen tens of thousands of basements ruined from
        moisture and mold. So, when we started Total Basement Finishing it was important to us to have
        a system that’s mold and moisture resistant. We also wanted a system that looks great, and is
        maintenance free, and finally, we wanted a system that is going to last as long as the home does.
        In other words, we want our system to look just as good 20 years from now as it did the day it was
        installed it. Just as good, just as crisp, and just as nice. Let me show you what we have for you.”</p>

        basement that you want to see in your home. If it was free you would take it? Of course you would. Besides the fact if it was free, why would
        you take it?” Be sure that the homeowner is comfortable with you, your company, and the products and design of the new

        <p>“Your proposal includes the EverLast Walls with a washable pre- finished surface that never
        needs to be painted with an R-13 insulation rating and a 50-year warranty against mold and
        water damage.” </p>

        <p>“The walls won’t get ruined if they get wet, and the baseboard never needs paint and won’t get
        ruined if it gets wet, and the crown molding at the top of the walls make it look rich and finished,
        and the six-panel doors with the (lever) hardware, and the Linen Ceiling with mineral wool tiles
        that have a 30 year warranty against mold and sagging, and you have “X” amount of can lights on
        dimmer switches and all the necessary switches and outlets.”
        “You want the open mahogany railing with a new wall mounted handrail. This is going to look
        elegant. It opens up the stairwell as you walk down it. We’re going to attain a building permit for
        you, and you’re getting decorative post surrounds to cover those old rusty steel columns in your
        basement.”</p>

        <p>“In addition, you want the SaniDry Air System. You’re going to love this, it really makes the air in
        the basement feel like the air upstairs and finally, you want ThermalDry Flooring with Charcoal
        carpeting that’s specifically made for the basement environment. It’s a lot warmer than just laying
        carpet on the cold, hard, damp concrete floor and it’s modular, so you can take a tile out and easily replace it with a fresh one if you have to. You’re getting all of this! Your basement is going
        to be beautiful!”</p>

        <p>“John and Mary, all I have to do, is click this green traffic light, and the cost of the project will
        show right here on the computer screen.”
        The salesperson continues:</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>
        “We’re going to click this button in just a minute, but first we’re going to play a little game. It’s
        called the price is right.</p>

        <p>At this point, the homeowner may act disappointed, but have no fear, just continue with the script:</p>
        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“John and Mary, you’re going to like this game. Money is involved. (The salesperson lays three
        checks across the table in front of the homeowner) I can write you a thousand dollar check
        towards your project if you can guess the price within $200 of the cost. I can write you a $500
        check if you can guess the price within $500, and I can write you a $200 check if you guess the
        price within $1,000 of the cost. So, Mary, I’ll start with you. How much do you think the project
        costs?”Whatever answer Mary gives you, write her answer down then, turn to the other spouse and say:</p>

        <p>Script

        <p>“John, it sounds like Mary doesn’t want to win any money. John, what do you think the project
        costs?” (Write his answer down. Now it’s time for the salesperson to guess.)
        Then slide the mouse over to one of the homeowners and say:</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“You click the green light.”
        If the salesperson did their job by making a compelling presentation, the homeowners should come within 15-20%
        of the actual price. When the price appears, assuming it’s lower than what you guessed, say:

        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“Look, it’s only $35742.” Then click the purple traffic light to show the approximate monthly payment and say:</p>

        <p>“And the approximate monthly investment is $532.” Then say:</p>
        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“Let me ask, is it too much for the project or too much for your monthly budget?”
        Homeowner: “It’s too much for my monthly budget.”</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“You know most of our customers don’t pay cash when they make a major purchase like a car or a
        project like this. They finance it and make comfortable monthly payments. What’s a comfortable
        monthly payment for you, $500 a month, $400 a month, just $300 a month?”

        some things away) “How much too much, did we miss you by?”
        C.R.I.S.</p>
        <p>Homeowner: “We didn’t want to spend over $25,000.”</p>
        <h2>Script</h2>


        <p>Clarify: “I see, you wanted to invest ($25,000) so we missed you by ($10,000)?”
        Rephrase: “So what you’re saying is, if we were closer to ($25,000) we would have gotten together
        and the (Smith) family would be enjoying their new finished basement? Wouldn’t they?”
        Isolate: “Is there any other reason that stopped you from moving forward besides the money?”
        Satisfy: “John and Mary, remember the cost of your project depends on two things: How big the
        finished space is and what features and options you choose to have in it. Would you mind if I did
        a quick overview of your project to see if we can save you any money?</p>

        and will be eligible for a 7% discount. This means you’d save $2,501. bringing the cost of your
        project down to only $33,240.”
        “I’m sure you’ll have to agree, to take advantage of the savings of $2,501, this is the best time to
        go ahead. Wouldn’t you agree?”
        Can I get the discount later?
        Homeowner: “If I decided to move forward next week, you would still honor the Preferred
        Customer Discount right?”</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“No. I can’t. It’s like going to Sears on a Tuesday and asking for the President’s Day sale price that
        was on Monday. There are laws against that. This savings can only be given upon the completion
        of the proposal.”</p>

        <p>Let’s do it your way</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“Okay, we can do it your way. I’m a reasonable person and our company is easy to do business
        with. Our customers appreciate this.
        Let me ask, is this the finished space you want to see in your home? Great.”
        Now click over to the price screen on Total Basement Vision and say:</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“John and Mary, I can work with you. I’m not going to require that you give a $_______ deposit
        as it says here on the screen. I’m willing to secure your savings with a $100 check. This way, you
        can still have the benefit of the Preferred Customer Discount and we can talk tomorrow and pick
        up where we left off.” “You can make the check out to Total Basement Finishing.”</p>

        <p>Button Up</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“John and Mary, we have everything all set and per your request we’ll talk again on _______day
        and wrap up any remaining questions you may have. Congratulations and welcome to the Total
        Basement Finishing family.”</p>
        <h1>Financing</h1>
        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“John and Mary, in my experience there’s two kinds of people when it comes to the money. There
        are people who want to finish their basement, but don’t have the money right now and there are
        people that have the money but think it’s more than I thought it would be. Let me ask, which one
        are you?”</p>
        <p>I want to do it when I get $ later</p>
        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“John and Mary, what’s going to be different in a few months?”
        “Well, I have something that I know you’ll love. We can finance this for you, and you don’t have
        to make any payments or pay any interest for 6 months (or a year). Then when you get the money
        you can pay it off. If you don’t want to pay for it before the 6 months, then you can begin making
        monthly payments. Sounds great, right?”
        I want to do it but I don’t have the $</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“You know most of our customers don’t pay cash when they make a major purchase like a car or a
        project like this. They finance it and make comfortable monthly payments. What’s a comfortable
        monthly payment for you, $500 a month, $400 a month, or just $300 a month.”
        It’s more than I thought it would be</p>

        <h1>Cost vs. Value</h1>
        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“John and Mary, can I ask you a question? What’s the average cost of a home in your
        neighborhood? And, what’s the average sq. ft. of a home here? Who’s better with a calculator?
        Okay, can you please divide the average cost of a home, by the average sq. ft. What does it cost
        per sq. ft. in your area? Now, you want to add 629 sq. ft. of usable space to your home. What’s 629
        multiplied by the average cost per sq. ft. of a home in your area come to? Wouldn’t you agree,
        you’re increasing the usable space of your home for a fraction of the cost? This is why finishing
        your basement yields such a good return on investment. This investment will continue to make
        you money as the real estate prices increase over time. A good home remodeling project is the
        only investment that you can make that will increase the value of your home while you are
        enjoying the benefits. Wouldn’t
        you agree?”</p>


        <h1>Thermometer Close</h1>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“On a scale of 1 to 10, one being you’re not interested at all and 10 being you want to move
        forward right now, where are you?” “What do you need to see or hear to make it a 10?”</p>

        <h1>Uncover Objections</h1>
        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“Help me. I don’t understand why you wouldn’t go forward with this right now?”
        “Under what circumstances would you finish your basement?”
        “Tell me more about the thought process in getting your project done.”</p>

        <p>Feel, Felt, Found</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>
        <p>“I understand how you feel. Other people who were in the same position felt the same way. But
        after getting more information found that….”
        “Does that make sense?” Then close with a simple, “So let’s get your new finished basement
        scheduled then, okay?”</p>

        <p>Review the Preferred Customer Discount</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“Remember the Preferred Customer Discount? It’s 7% off, which is a savings of______ dollars.
        That is only available to customers who move forward with their new finished basement the day
        they receive their proposal. I wanted to remind you of that, because this is the best time to buy.
        Don’t you agree?” I want to shop around.</p>

        <h2 id="price-assurance-guarantee">Price Assurance Guarantee</h2>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“John and Mary, I understand that you want to get another estimate to be sure you are getting the
        best price possible. Right? If you had another company come and give you an estimate, and let’s
        say that their company holds the same standards as we do, their system, the scope of work, and
        workmanship were the same caliber as ours and their price was much lower, you would probably
        do business with them. Right? And let’s say that you had another company come out to give you
        an estimate and their company, and system were not as good as ours and their price was higher,
        you would do business with us right?” (Homeowner says, “Right”) “Thank you.”
        “That’s why we have our Price Assurance Guarantee. What this essentially says is, you have 30
        days to get other estimates. And if the company, products and materials, workmanship, and the
        scope of work is the same standard as ours, we will match the price plus put $100 in your pocket
        if you find such a company, I don’t think you will.”
        “So, can I welcome you into the TBF family?”
        Last Shot Promise</p>

        <h2>Script</h2>

        <p>“Can I ask you a question?”</p><p> “Are you still comfortable with my company?”</p><p> “And are you still comfortable with me?”</p><p> “And you’re okay with the work we propose, right?”</p><p>“Okay, I have spent 2 ½ hours with you today. Can you make me one promise: when you get another estimate, if there is something that you like better about it, you’ll give me a call and give  me the last shot at earning your business?”When the homeowner says yes, shake his or her hand and say, “It’s a deal.”</p>
